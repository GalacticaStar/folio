## ABOUT

This is my Portfolio Website. I introduce myself a little and allow you to search a database of my curent techstack. Or... you can just scroll down and see what's up.

## Key Features

I created my portfolio using these key technologies-
* React
* Express
* SQLite3
* Javascript ES6

You'll notice the ability to search a database (using RESTful API practices), Smooth snap scrolling, a series of projects that I have worked on, and a complete list of my current techstack.

## How To Use

You'll need two terminals open in the parent folder.
1. On the first run '''node server.js''' ensuring that your '''port 4000''' is available.
2. In the second terminal run 'npm start' to start the React Development server (You must have React installed).
3. Enjoy my profile! :metal:
4. If you wish to view the live version of my projects you may need to ensure you've been granted premission for the Heroku CORS test server. This can be done [here](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo).
